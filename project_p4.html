            <h3>Unexpected IT Classroom Stories</h3>
            <p>
              We had no idea there were so many dumb IT trainers and students
              out there.
            </p>
            <p>The stories just keep coming in.</p>

            <h3>When Copying Goes Too Far</h3>
            <p>
              David Tune of Boambee, NSW, was reminded of a particularly clever
              pair of IT Diploma students who handed in a joint research
              assignment, complete with the required signed statement that it
              was all their original work.
            </p>

            <h3>Uncovering the Truth</h3>
            <p>
              Tune recalls: "Upon reading the work for grading, I was incredibly
              impressed to find three pages of the document written in perfect
              technical German, particularly given that the students in question
              were none too articulate when I asked 'Sprechen sie Deutsch?'
            </p>
            <p>
              End result: assignment rejected, students counselled and more care
              taken when cutting and pasting to cover assignment work.

            <h2>THAT'S MY LECTURE</h2>
            <p>
              Anyone attending an IT lecture should expect that the lecturer
              knows the subject. But IT lecturers are a funny lot.

            <h3>The Lecture That Went Wrong</h3>
            <p>
              Jun Li, a programmer, recalls working in IT support at a school.
            </p>
            <p>
              "I was told to set up a projector in one of the meeting rooms for
              school staff, as there was a presentation. Having done that, I
              hooked the presentation laptop to the network and tried to help
              one of the speakers from the IT faculty update the laptop to IE7.
              I logged off and asked her to log on with her account to try IE7.
            </p>
            <p>
              'What is that?' she asked when the IE7 install process asked
              whether phishing should be turned on. After I explained it, she
              told me that she was about to present a talk on internet
              security."

              Neil Meyers, library assistant from Gilles Plains in SA, recalls
              an incident with a part-time computer lecturer a couple of years
              ago.

            <h3>The Floppy Disk Confusion</h3>
            <p>
              "I work in a vocational education library, and, on night shift,
              library staff are the default computer
              technicians/troubleshooters. One night, this part-time lecturer
              came to the counter, stating that she'd managed to get a CD-ROM
              disc stuck in the drive. She also said she felt a bit foolish,
              because she was instructing a class in basic computing and was
              unable to solve the problem in front of a room full of students.
            </p>
            <p>
              So I wandered over to give her assistance, pushed the drive eject
              button, out popped the tray and... no disc to be seen.
            </p>
            <p>
              Before I was able to ask out the obvious question, she piped up,
              'That's the CD drive? I thought it was the other one!', pointing
              to an old 5.25in floppy disc slot, which was there even though the
              drives themselves had long since been decommissioned.
            </p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3>The Incident Continues</h3>
            <p>
              Someone from IT got out the disc the next day when they upended
              the machine and it fell out. Then, a week later, after I gave the
              lecturer her CD back, she was back within five minutes, saying,
              'You won't believe it, I've done it again!'
            </p>
            <p>
              And this was their computing tutor? So there I am in front of her
              class, shaking the heck out of the machine. So much for teaching
              people to handle their computers with care!"

            <h3>DOESN'T IT JUST WORK?</h3>
            <p>
              Ian Caldewell, a self-styled 'PC tinkerer', refurbishes PCs, and
              has ways of acquiring modems, monitors, CPUs, boxes and RAM - to
              the point where it has become a pastime consuming most of his
              leisure time. He now has streams of people seeking repairs, advice
              and assistance.
            </p>
            <p>
              "Recently, I replaced an old power supply for a couple, and, when
              they came to collect, they asked whether I made house calls.
            </p>
            <p>I said I could and asked what they needed."</p>
            <p>
              The lady told Caldewell she'd bought a new wireless mouse, and,
              since it was the last one on display, it didn't come with a box or
              instructions.
            </p>
            <p>
              "I asked her: 'Did you put batteries in it?!' She hadn't, of
              course."

            <h3>MAKE MY DAY, PC</h3>
            <p>
              Chris Aitken, a designer and programmer from Camden, NSW, believes
              his story proves that tech support is one of the most stressful
              jobs on earth. He recalls working for a small internet provider in
              the late '90s, when one of the customers was a local police
              officer.
            </p>
            <p>
              "He was also an expert in crashing Windows 98. On one occasion, he
              brought his tower into the office, sat it on the counter, pulled
              his service pistol out of his holster and pointed it straight at
              the tower, threatening to shoot it.
            </p>
            <p>
              Another time he put his (by now very nervous) PC tower onto the
              counter, again took out his pistol, held it by the barrel and
              started banging the butt of the gun onto the top of the computer,
              quite hard too.
            </p>
            <p>It's no wonder techies go grey - or bald - early!"</p>
            <p>
              This is the first we've heard of someone trying to fix a computer
              by intimidating it.
