            <h3>Unexpected IT Classroom Stories</h3>
            <p>
              We had no idea there were so many dumb IT trainers and students
              out there.
            </p>
            <p>The stories just keep coming in.</p>

            <h3>When Copying Goes Too Far</h3>
            <p>
              David Tune of Boambee, NSW, was reminded of a particularly clever
              pair of IT Diploma students who handed in a joint research
              assignment, complete with the required signed statement that it
              was all their original work.

            <h3>Uncovering the Truth</h3>
            <p>
              Tune recalls: "Upon reading the work for grading, I was incredibly
              impressed to find three pages of the document written in perfect
              technical German, particularly given that the students in question
              were none too articulate when I asked 'Sprechen sie Deutsch?'
            </p>
            <p>
              End result: assignment rejected, students counselled and more care
              taken when cutting and pasting to cover assignment work.

            <h2>THAT'S MY LECTURE</h2>
            <p>
              Anyone attending an IT lecture should expect that the lecturer
              knows the subject. But IT lecturers are a funny lot.

            <h3>The Lecture That Went Wrong</h3>
            <p>
              Jun Li, a programmer, recalls working in IT support at a school.
            </p>
            <p>
              "I was told to set up a projector in one of the meeting rooms for
              school staff, as there was a presentation. Having done that, I
              hooked the presentation laptop to the network and tried to help
              one of the speakers from the IT faculty update the laptop to IE7.
              I logged off and asked her to log on with her account to try IE7.
            </p>
            <p>
              'What is that?' she asked when the IE7 install process asked
              whether phishing should be turned on. After I explained it, she
              told me that she was about to present a talk on internet
              security."

            <h3>Introducing Neil Meyers</h3>
            <p>
              Neil Meyers, library assistant from Gilles Plains in SA, recalls
              an incident with a part-time computer lecturer a couple of years
              ago.

            <h3>The Floppy Disk Confusion</h3>
            <p>
              "I work in a vocational education library, and, on night shift,
              library staff are the default computer
              technicians/troubleshooters. One night, this part-time lecturer
              came to the counter, stating that she'd managed to get a CD-ROM
              disc stuck in the drive. She also said she felt a bit foolish,
              because she was instructing a class in basic computing and was
              unable to solve the problem in front of a room full of students.
            </p>
            <p>
              So I wandered over to give her assistance, pushed the drive eject
              button, out popped the tray and... no disc to be seen.
            </p>
            <p>
              Before I was able to ask out the obvious question, she piped up,
              'That's the CD drive? I thought it was the other one!', pointing
              to an old 5.25in floppy disc slot, which was there even though the
              drives themselves had long since been decommissioned.
            </p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3>The Incident Continues</h3>
            <p>
              Someone from IT got out the disc the next day when they upended
              the machine and it fell out. Then, a week later, after I gave the
              lecturer her CD back, she was back within five minutes, saying,
              'You won't believe it, I've done it again!'
            </p>
            <p>
              And this was their computing tutor? So there I am in front of her
              class, shaking the heck out of the machine. So much for teaching
              people to handle their computers with care!"
